### Features

The website consists of three pages and a modal. Home, Packages, Gallery and Booking modal.

#### All four pages have the following elements in common:

* A responsive navigation bar at the top of the page allowing the user to easily explore the website. On the left hand side of the navigation bar is the Dhadda's Detailing logo. On the right hand-side of the navigation bar are links to the packages page, gallery page and booking page. To enable a positive user experience the navigation links are condensed into a burger toggler button on smaller devices. This was done to prevent the navigation bar from looking cluttered. 

* A footer which comprises of social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube. The footer also contains the address and phone number of the company.

#### Home Page
* A hero image displaying a photograph of a car dripping in soap suds.
* A heading and paragraph explaining who Dhadda's Detailing are.
* Three images of clean cars with a central button which takes the user through to the packages page.
* A where to find us section, displaying a map from Google and the company address and phone number.

#### Packages Page
* A hero image displaying a clean car.
* The three packages which are on offer to the user.
* A book now button underneath the packages to allow the user easy access to the bookings modal.

#### Gallery Page
* A hero image displaying a clean car, to keep in theme with the rest of the website.
* A carousel showcasing Dhadda's detailing completed work. This will give confidence to the user in the companies ability.
* A testimonials section from previous customers. Again, this will give confidence to the user in the companies ability.

#### Future Implementations
* Products page - This page would sell Dhadda's Detailing's own products.
* Add more services when they become available such a cermaic coating, PPF and window tinting.

### Accessibility 

I've taken care when coding to make the website as user-friendly and as accessible as I can. I've accomplished this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes for images throughout the site.
* Ensuring that the site has an adequate amount of colour contrast.
