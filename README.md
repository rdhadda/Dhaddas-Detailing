- To make it easy for potential customers to view the services/packages on offer.
- To make it obvious to customers how to reach us and where we are located.
- Have the ability to make a booking.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Dhadda's Detailing Colour Palette](docs/colourscheme.png)

I opted for a clean modern colour pallete where each colour compliments one another. The colour pallete was created using the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- Roboto is used across the site for all text on the site. It is a sans-serif font.

![Roboto Google Fonts](docs/roboto.png)

### Imagery

All images on the webpage were taken from unsplash.com. I have credited these in the [credits](#credits) section.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

[Desktop Wireframes](docs/desktop-wireframe.png)

[Tablet Wireframes](docs/tablet-wireframe.png)

[Mobile Wireframes](docs/mobile-wireframe.png)

### Features

The website consists of three pages and a modal. Home, Packages, Gallery and Booking modal.

#### All three pages have the following elements in common:

- A responsive navigation bar at the top of the page allowing the user to easily explore the website. On the left hand side of the navigation bar is the Dhadda's Detailing logo. On the right hand-side of the navigation bar are links to the packages page, gallery page and booking modal. To enable a positive user experience the navigation links are condensed into a burger toggler button on smaller devices. This was done to prevent the navigation bar from looking cluttered.

- A footer which comprises of social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube. The footer also contains the address of the company.

#### Home Page

- A hero image displaying a photograph of a car dripping in soap suds.
- A heading and paragraph explaining who Dhadda's Detailing are.
- Three images of clean cars.
- A testimonials section from previous customers. Again, this will give confidence to the user in the companies ability.
- A where to find us section, displaying a map from Google and the company address, email and phone number. The map on the Homepage points to a coffee house in Ireland. As Dhadda's Detailing is not a real business I opted to use the iframe link from the coffee coders project.

#### Packages Page

- A hero image displaying a clean car.
- The three packages which are on offer to the user.
- Text explaining the packages.
- A book now button underneath the packages to allow the user easy access to the bookings modal.

#### Gallery Page

- A hero image displaying a clean car, to keep in theme with the rest of the website.
- Text welcoming users to the gallery page.
- A grid gallery showcasing Dhadda's detailing completed work. This will give confidence to the user in the companies ability.

#### Booking Modal

- A modal which is initiated from a Book Now button on the nav bar and the packages page.
- A form within the modal which requires the users input.
- A thank you modal, once the user has submitted the requested information.

#### Future Implementations

- Products page - This page would sell Dhadda's Detailing's own products.
- Add more services when they become available such as PPF and window tinting.

### Accessibility

I've taken care when coding to make the website as user-friendly and as accessible as I can. I've accomplished this by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes for images throughout the site.
- Selecting a sans-serif font which is suitable for users with dyslexia.
- Ensuring that the site has an adequate amount of colour contrast.

## Testing

Testing was continuous throughout the website build. I used Chrome developer tools to identify and address any issues as they arose.

- Upon meeting with my mentor we identified that my initial colour scheme had contrast issues. This has been resolved by choosing a new colour scheme which allows for adequate contrast been background and foreground colours.

- My mentor also pointed out that the images within the website were .png format which hindered the performance of the website. To combat this all images have been converted to .webp format to significantly improve performance.

- On the Packages page. the list items were out of alignment and not centered even after using the bootstrap text-center class. This was due to padding, which has now been removed to center the list items.

### W3C Validator

W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

One issue I was was coming across when testing my html page was an error displayed by w3. Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.' However, even after removing these trailing slashes when saving my document Visual Studio Code would re-enter them. Luckily as w3 states these have no effect on the code.

- [Index Page HTML](docs/w3-index.html.png)
- [Packages Page HTML](docs/w3-packages.html.png)
- [Gallery Page HTML](docs/w3-gallery.html.png)
- [404 Page HTML](docs/w3-404.html.png)
- [style.css CSS](docs/w3-style.css.png)

### Solved Bugs

1. When on smaller devices , bootstraps default toggle button, toggles all of the menu items to the left. I didn't want this, i wanted them to be central. in order to overcome the default bootstrap settings, I researched the bootstrap website to find the class 'align-items-center'. I applied this class to my unordered list, the menu items now appear in the center when the burger icon is clicked on smaller devices.

2. The text on the hero image on the index.html page were not re-sizing when transitioning onto smaller devices, they were covering the image more than i wanted them to. By using a media query I've managed to resize the text for a better viewing experience on smaller devices.

3. When adding the iframe to the the bootstrap column I wanted to centralize the iframe. I tried various classes off bootstrap to no avail. Through trial and error I found a combination of classes off bootstrap and my own custom CSS managed to overcome this obstacle.

4. Images were appearing stretched. After a little research I came across a solution using max-width:100%; and height:auto which is the bootstrap class img-fluid. This prevents the image from becoming distorted, it also helps with the responsiveness of images.

5. The middle image in the three images underneath the who are we section, was taller than the images beside it. I wanted them to all be the same height and width. At first I set a fixed height to the column and set the overflow to none. This looked great on the desktop but as the screen size decreased the same problem occurred. I felt that this wasn't a good viewing experience. In the end i ended up re-sizing the images using BIRME. The issue was resolved.

6. On the Packages.html page I've used Bootstraps grid layout. At first, I set the column width to 4. However, when adding a margin to each column it caused the end column to drop onto a new row. I didn't want this behavior. After reading the bootstrap literature, rather than taking up the whole row I opted for column width of 3 allowing me to center my content using the justify-content-center class and play around with margins.

7. When deploying my website via github I noticed that some of the images on the gallery page were no longer rendering properly. After a google search I realised that the issue was to do with the aspect ratio of my images. After changing the aspect ratio the images now render correctly.

8.The lower large image on the gallery page on the desktop view is out of alignment with the 4 images to the left of it. After my meeting with my mentor he helped me diagnose the issue. The container for the image had a max height set to 512px, which was limiting the size of the image. I've since removed this and the pictures are now aligned.

### Known Bugs

1. The required fields on my book now modal do not work. This is because i'm using the data-dismiss attribute on the book button, the book button also triggers the opening of the thank you modal. The data-dismiss attribute doesn't take the required attribute into account. This should hopefully be resolved using Javascript.

### Testing User Stories

  - Users are able to navigate to the Packages page to see what packages are available to them.
    ![Packages page of website](docs/userstories/packages.png)

- I want to see pictures of previous work carried out.

  - Previous work can be viewed by visiting the gallery page.
    ![Gallery page of website](docs/userstories/gallery.png)

    ![Booking Modal](docs/userstories/bookingmodal.png)

    ![Thank you Modal](docs/userstories/thankyoumodal.png)

#### Returning Visitors

- I want to be able to make a booking
  - Returning users can make a booking using the book now button on the navbar or from the book now button on the packages page.

### Lighthouse Testing

I took the opportunity to utilize Lighthouse within Chrome Developer Tools. This allowed me to test for performance, accessibility, best practices and the SEO (search engine optimization) of the website.

#### Index.html Desktop Page

![Lighthouse index.html Desktop](docs/lighthouse-index-desktop.png)

#### Packages.html Desktop Page

![Lighthouse packages.html Desktop](docs/lighthouse-packages-desktop.png)

#### Gallery.html Desktop Page

![Lighthouse gallery.html Desktop](docs/lighthouse-gallery-desktop.png)

#### 404.html Desktop Page

![Lighthouse 404.html Desktop](docs/lighthouse-404-desktop.png)

The main recommendation to improve my lighthouse score were to appropriately size images. I achieved this by utilizing websites such as Birme and Sqoosh.

Another recommendation is to Eliminate render-blocking resources. However, these are resources such as Bootstrap and Google font's. These are key resources to my website.

Overall i'm happy with the Lighthouse scores for my desktop version of Dhadda's Detailing.

### Mobile Testing

#### Index.html Desktop Page

![Lighthouse index.html Mobile](docs/lighthouse-index-mobile.png)

#### Packages.html Desktop Page

![Lighthouse packages.html Mobile](docs/lighthouse-packages-mobile.png)

#### Gallery.html Desktop Page

![Lighthouse gallery.html Mobile](docs/lighthouse-gallery-mobile.png)

#### 404.html Desktop Page

![Lighthouse 404.html Mobile](docs/lighthouse-404-mobile.png)

The main factor affecting the performance across all three pages is to Eliminate render blocking resources. As these resources play a key role in the website it's difficult to eliminate them.

I feel there is room for improvement for the performance of the mobile version of Dhadda's detailing. One method I tried to implement to improve this was to give my gallery images specific height and widths through media queries. Unfortunately this didn't improve my performance score. As my knowledge grows through the course I hope to improve on this.
